# 🚀 SQA Project – Evershop (demo.evershop.io)

I had the opportunity to contribute to the **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** process for [Evershop](https://demo.evershop.io), a modern open-source e-commerce platform.

My focus was to ensure the platform delivered a seamless, secure, and high-performance user experience by conducting rigorous testing across functional and non-functional areas.
