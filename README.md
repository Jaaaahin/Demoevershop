🚀 Excited to Share My SQA Experience with Evershop! 🚀

I had the opportunity to work on Evershop (demo.evershop.io), an advanced e-commerce platform, where I was responsible for Software Quality Assurance (SQA). My role involved designing and executing comprehensive test cases to ensure the platform's functionality, performance, and security.

🔍 Key Testing Areas:
✅ Functional Testing: Verified user flows, including login, product search, cart management, and checkout.
✅ UI & UX Testing: Ensured a seamless experience across devices and browsers.
✅ API Testing: Used Postman to validate REST API responses and integrations.
✅ Automation Testing: Developed test scripts using Selenium with JavaScript to automate key scenarios.
✅ Performance Testing: Utilized JMeter to analyze site performance under load.
✅ Security Testing: Checked authentication, authorization, and data security measures.

💡 Through rigorous testing, I helped identify and resolve issues before deployment, ensuring Evershop delivered a smooth and reliable user experience.

I'm always eager to explore new SQA challenges and collaborate with like-minded professionals. Let’s connect and share insights on software testing and automation!
